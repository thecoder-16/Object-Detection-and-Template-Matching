	Object detection and counting in images based on template object.
	
MST2: Matches object and template of same size using Block matching Algorithm.
MST3: Matches object and template of different sizes as well using Gaussian Pyramid Algorithm.

How to run:

1. python main_MST2/3.py
2. give image path
3. give template path
